# Destiny2-BansheeMods
# Sends Email with the daily Banshee Mods

Changes:
  - Create a file called "content.txt" and add the path to "textfilepath"
  - The images of the mods are being downloaded if the file is not there already... Define a path to ".../imgs/{}"
  - Add a "FROM" email address and a "TO" email address
  - Edit f1 variable in email function
  - Create password.txt and type in the password of the email address that sends the email
  - Maybe you need Chromedriver

On the bottom of the file there is a schedule script which has to be uncommented to work.
